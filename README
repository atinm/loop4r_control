loop4r_control for controlling sooperlooper via an FCB1010 with the EurekaProm
set to I/O mode. The goal is to allow control of sooperlooper via just the
controller and have the LEDs etc reflect the state of sooperlooper.

Forked from the https://github.com/gbevin/ReceiveMIDI and
https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI source as a MIDI starting point.
